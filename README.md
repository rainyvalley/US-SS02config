# US-SS02config
US-SS02 humidity configuration with 20-minute minimum timer (when manually pressed), as well as auto on at 50% humidity, and auto off after 45% humidity & 20 minutes have passed.

Upload to your Tasmota device (paste it into the console).

Change the second timer by setting "1200" to whatever you'd like, and change humidity points as well, via the AHT2X#Humidity>X figure where X is your humidity percentages. 

One word of warning is the humidity sensor is quite off in the US-SS002 so I would set it lower than you expect.
