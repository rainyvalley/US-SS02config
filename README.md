# US-SS02config
US-SS02 humidity configuration with 20 minute minimum timer. Upload to your tasmota device and  paste into console. Change the second timer by setting "1200" to whatever you'd like, and change humidity points as well. One word of warning is the humidity sensor is quite off in the US-SS002 so I would set it lower than you expect.
